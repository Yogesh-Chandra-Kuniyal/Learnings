Linked List:

head -> |value + refernce/pointer| -> |tail| -> null


-> NODE = value + pointer


-> Linear Structure
-> Non - contigeous
-> Insertion and Deletion is easy ---------------- TC = O(n)
-> Dynamic Size
-> Nodes are linked together by a reference field
-> Fetching element is hard ---------------------- TC = O(n)
-> Extra Memory


Two types of linked list:
1. Single Linked List
2. Doubly Linked List


Use case:
-> Insertion and Deletion is easy
-> Avoid resizing overhead or unknown size upfront
-> Do lots of teversal/manipulation
